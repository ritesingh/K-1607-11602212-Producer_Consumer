CSE-316(Simulation Based Project): Programming Solution to Bounded-Buffer Problem. I have used standard counting semaphores
for empty, full. A mutex lock is used rather than a binary semaphore for obtaining mutual exclusion.
There are two threads Producer and Consumer where Producer adds an item to the buffer and Consumer obtains an item from the
buffer. The programming solution has been done for a linux platform using thread library and will require the same to compile
it successfully.
